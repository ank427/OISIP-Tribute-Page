                <h2>Charismatic Indian Revolutionary</h2>
                <p>
                    <b> Bhagat Singh</b> was one of the most prominent and renowned freedom fighters of India. He was a socialist revolutionary who bravely fought for the independence of the country. He was born in September 1907 in Banga village in Punjab
                    to a Sikh family. His father’s name was Kishan Singh and his mother’s name was Vidyavati. Some of his family members were active participants of the Indian Independence Movement, while others were part of Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s army.
                    He was a strong supporter of the Swadeshi Movement. He only wore Khadi. In later years, his trust in non-violence reduced. He began to believe that only armed rebellion could bring independence. He was then highly influenced by Lala
                    Lajpat Rai. Bhagat Singh was hanged on 23 March 1931 in Lahore along with his associates, Shivaram Rajguru and Sukhdev.
